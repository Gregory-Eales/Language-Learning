# Variables, Expressions, and Statements

# there are a different data types built into python

# this is an int
print(type(1))
# this is a floating point number
print(type(1.0))
# this is a string
print(type("string"))

# these are examples of variables in python
# storing different data types in a name
# the name is then used in place of the datatype
# variables can be reasigned to new data types if desired
x = 1
yes = "no"
poop = "pee"
